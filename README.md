# Heart Disease Prediction using EDA, Feature Engineering, and XGBoost

This project aims to explore heart disease data using Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), feature engineering, and machine learning with XGBoost. The goal is to predict heart disease based on key health indicators.

## Project Structure

- **EDA**: Perform in-depth data exploration and visualization to uncover patterns.
- **Feature Engineering**: Create meaningful features to improve model performance.
- **XGBoost**: Train a machine learning model to predict heart disease.

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository.
2. Install the required dependencies.
3. Run the notebook for EDA and model training.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook

## Installation
